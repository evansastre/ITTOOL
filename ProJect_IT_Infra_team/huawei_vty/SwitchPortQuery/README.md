Description of the tip information in the program:
-- working
?? Is the tip after successful connection
-- Request timeout
?? Is this address unreachable, connect timeout
-- disconnected
??? After connect, there is no output state after 60 seconds, disconnected. Once there is a "UP" or "DOWN" status, this time will count from zero.
-- no message about up&down
??? After connect, there is always output (maybe the POE error state has been jumping), and there is no possibility of getting "UP" or "DOWN". After 120 seconds, disconnected
